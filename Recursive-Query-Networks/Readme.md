## Recursive Query Networks

This repository consists of two different datasets, one of the **Air-Transport-Network** and the other of the **Scientific-Collaboration-Network**. The codes and data corresponding to these can be found in the respective directories.

In the **Air-Transport-Network** section, we are given a real world Flights and Airports dataset. It is an example of transport networks and spatial datasets. The assignment requires us to answer 11 different queries corresponding to this dataset, which can be found in the file of **air_network.sql** in that directory. More details can be found in **Assignment-2.pdf**

In the **Scientific-Collaboration-Network** section, we are given a synthetically generated dataset. The actual dataset was kept hidden from the students and so we were supposed to create a dataset of our own in order to test the queries written by us. This dataset is a social network with the nodes being scientists and the links being co-authorships. The assignment requires us to answer 11 different queries (refer to **Assignment-2.pdf**) corresponding to this. These queries are written in the **scientific_collabs.sql** file that can be found in the respective directory.

The file **query.sql** consists of all the total 22 queries. The repository of **Individual_queries** corresponds to the SQl file for each of the 22 queries. You can also find the Preamble and the cleanup sections corresponding to the Views etc defined by me in the queries. The file **checker.py** was provided by the instructors to check the format of our files
