## IPL Data Stats

This repository consists of the different queries written by me that were used to analyse the IPL data from the years 2008 - 2016. This analysis was done in PostgreSQL. 

The data used can be found in the directory **IPL DB** here. The description of the assignment and the different queries involved can be found in the **Assignment-1.pdf** file. A total of 22 queries were asked to be solved by the students. My solution to these queries can be found in the file of **query.sql**, while the solution provided by the instructions later on is **query_gold.sql**. 

The repository of **Individual_queries** corresponds to the SQl file for each of the 22 queries and the solution given by these queries can be found in **outputs** directory. We were also requried to measure the time taken to execute each query and plot them and that bar graph can be seen in **query_time.pdf**. The file of **db_build.sql** is just to create a PostgreSQL database by using the IPL data given in the repository of **IPL DB**.
